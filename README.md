# NoMoreBorderGo
Currently a clone of [NoMoreBorder](https://github.com/invcble/NoMoreBorder) I used to learn Go, but I plan on differentiating this app into its own thing.

## Development

I use [air](https://github.com/air-verse/air) to live-reload the app as I make changes. You can install it using the following command:
```sh
go install github.com/air-verse/air@latest
```
And then just run
```sh
air
```
to start it. It uses the `.air.toml` file in the repository by default.
